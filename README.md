# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop - Sprint 2

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. This includes NAV links, animations, embedded youtube videos, and a reservation form.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)
##Future ideas
-will include an online ordering system that can send live updates via text message.
-It sounds campy, I will add more animations for a coffee marketing program.
